Developer work requires these additional tools:
    - autoconf
    - automake
    - libtool

To build from a cvs checkout, after "make maintainer-clean", or after
modifying configure.ac or any Makefile.am:
    autoreconf --install
    ./configure [options]
    make

To build a distribution and make sure it works, use:
    make distcheck
