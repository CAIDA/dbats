Developer work requires these additional tools:
    - autoconf
    - automake
    - libtool

After checking out from CVS, you must do:
    autoreconf --install

After modifying configure.ac or any Makefile.am, you should do:
    autoreconf

Then you can build with the usual commands:
    ./configure [options]
    make

To build a distribution and make sure it works, use:
    make distcheck
