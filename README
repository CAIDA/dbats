DBATS - DataBase of Aggregated Time Series
Version 0.1

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Requirements

  - Berkeley DB 5.x (preferably 5.3 or later)

The mod_dbats apache httpd module additionally requires:

  - Apache httpd 2.2 or later
  - apxs (should be included with Apache)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Building

To build and install dbats:
    ./configure [options]
    make
    make check ;#(optional)
    make install

To install the optional mod_dbats apache module:
    As root (or other user with permission to restart apache), run
    "make install-apache" in the dbats build tree.  This will do the
    following:
    1. if an old dbats module is already loaded, disable it and restart server
    2. install and enable the new dbats module
    3. restart apache server

Most of the GNU standard configure options and make targets are also
available.

If your libdb is installed in a nonstandard location $dir/lib and
the corresponding db.h header is in $dir/include, you should use the
./configure option "--with-libdb-prefix=$dir".  This should work whether
libdb is static or shared.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Programs

Run any program with the "-?" option for a list of options.

* dbats_init
  Create a DBATS database and optionally define aggregates and keys.

* dbats_info
  Display information about a DBATS database.

* dbats_recover
  Recover a damaged DBATS database.  This is useful when any app reports
  "dbats_open: BDB0087 DB_RUNRECOVERY: Fatal error, run database recovery",
  which can occur after an app is killed without cleanly closing the db.

* dbats_series_limit
  Set the maximum number of data points to store in a timeseries.

* dbats_best_bundle
  Find the bundle that best covers the specified time range.

* report-in
* report-out
  Example programs that write to and read from a DBATS database.
