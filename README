DBATS - DataBase of Aggregated Time Series
Version 0.1

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Requirements

  - Berkeley DB 5.x (preferably 5.3 or later)

The mod_dbats apache httpd module additionally requires:

  - Apache httpd 2.2 or later
  - apxs (should be included with Apache)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Building

To build and install dbats:
    ./configure [options]
    make
    make check ;#(optional)
    make install

To install the optional mod_dbats apache module:
    As root (or other user with permission to restart apache), run
    "make install-apache" in the dbats build tree.  This will do the
    following:
    1. if an old dbats module is already loaded, disable it and restart server
    2. install and enable the new dbats module
    3. restart apache server

Most of the GNU standard configure options and make targets are also
available.

If your libdb is installed in a nonstandard location $dir/lib and
the corresponding db.h header is in $dir/include, you should use the
./configure option "--with-libdb-prefix=$dir".  This should work whether
libdb is static or shared.
