TSDB (TimeSeries DataBase)
--------------------------

Timeseries (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series) are used to represent events at specific times. Popular tools such as rrdtool (http://www.rrdtool.org) made it possible to handle time series easily. Unfortunately RRD falls short when
- handling thousand/million time series due to high update time and disk-space used
- data have to be exported on a web 2.0 GUI

For this reason we developed TSDB.

test.c
Allows you to play with the API and see how it works

tsdbExport
Allows you to export data in both text and Json format
