DBATS - DataBase of Aggregated Time Series
Version 0.1

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Requirements

  - Berkeley DB 5.x (preferably 5.3 or later)

The mod_dbats apache httpd module additionally requires:

  - Apache httpd 2.2 or later
  - apxs (should be included with Apache)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Building

To build and install dbats:
    ./configure [options]
    make
    make check ;#(optional)
    make install

To install the optional mod_dbats apache module:
    make install-apache

Most of the GNU standard configure options and make targets are also
available.

If libdb is a shared library and is installed in a nonstandard location $dir,
you will need to pass the appropriate options to your linker so that mod_dbats
can find libdb at runtime.  For example, adding "-Wl,-rpath -Wl,$dir" or
"-rpath $dir" or "-R $dir" to LDFLAGS during ./configure, or setting
LD_RUN_PATH="$dir" in the environment during "make".
